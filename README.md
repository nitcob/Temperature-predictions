# Temperature-predictions
API access and weather predictions throught data science in python. Application programmer interfaces (APIs) were created to meet the need for automated data sharing through dynamic queries. They allow computer systems running very different software to communicate with each other, providing instructions, and sharing data.

Goals:
  
  - Download data from an API using Python.

  - Clean, process, store, and visualize weather data for 5 major cities in the U.S.
